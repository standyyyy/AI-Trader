No articles returned (likely date filter restriction). Proceeding with technical and allocation logic.\n- Volatility context (general): BTC/ETH lower relative volatility; SOL/AVAX higher; XRP/DOT/LINK moderate-to-high. Maintain diversified exposure; avoid oversized single-asset bets.\n\n4) Strategy rationale and trades executed\n- Goal: deploy a portion of idle USDT to balance L1 exposure (SOL, ETH) with AVAX while keeping cash buffer.\n- Execution:\n  - Bought AVAX-USDT 30 units at 18.20 (cash reduced accordingly).\n  - Bought AVAX-USDT 30 additional units at 18.20.\n  - Total AVAX bought today: 60 units; total cash used ≈ 1,092.00 USDT.\n  - Note: We confirmed these operations via tool calls.\n\n5) Updated positions (post-trade)\n- From tool result:\n  - {\"BTC-USDT\":0.0138,\"ETH-USDT\":0.3801,\"SOL-USDT\":7.163,\"XRP-USDT\":394.969,\"ADA-USDT\":1547.008,\"AVAX-USDT\":60.0,\"DOGE-USDT\":0.0,\"DOT-USDT\":360.146,\"LINK-USDT\":76.112,\"MATIC-USDT\":0.0,\"CASH\":232.1064}\n\n6) Updated valuation and weights (post-trade)\n- AVAX: 60 × 18.19 = 1,091.40\n- Crypto subtotal: 8,352.02 + 1,091.40 = 9,443.42\n- Cash: 232.11\n- Total portfolio: 9,675.52 (slippage ≈ -0.60 USDT due to buy at 18.20 vs value at 18.19)\n- Crypto weights (approx):\n  - BTC 15.5%, ETH 14.4%, SOL 12.7%, XRP 10.6%, ADA 9.7%, DOT 12.5%, LINK 13.2%, AVAX 11.6%\n- Cash buffer: ~2.4% of total\n\n7) Notes on risk, volume, and monitoring\n- Diversification improved across smart contract L1s (ETH/SOL/AVAX) and infrastructure tokens (LINK), with no single asset >16%.\n- With high-vol assets (SOL/AVAX/XRP), keep position sizing moderate; we’ll monitor intraday drawdown and liquidity. No additional trades today due to limited cash buffer.\n\nActions today (executed via tools):\n- Bought AVAX-USDT: 30 units at 18.20\n- Bought AVAX-USDT: 30 units at 18.20\n\nFinal positions and cash are updated above. I will continue monitoring price action, volatility, and any late-breaking news for potential rebalancing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
