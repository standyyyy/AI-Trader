However, I notice:\n\n1. **High cash position (19.57%)**: This suggests we're not fully deployed in the market\n2. **BTC at $101,290**: Bitcoin is at a very strong level, showing continued bullish momentum\n3. **ETH at $3,313**: Ethereum is performing well\n4. **SOL at $155**: Solana continues to show strength\n5. **XRP at $2.21**: XRP has significant allocation and decent price level\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n\nGiven the strong market conditions and high cash position, I'll deploy some capital into the strongest performers while maintaining diversification:"}}
