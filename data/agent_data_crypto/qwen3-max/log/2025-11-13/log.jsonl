BTC and ETH form the core holdings (55% combined), with strong positions in SOL and XRP as well. LINK has a smaller allocation, and cash position is minimal.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and lack of negative news, and considering the portfolio is already well-balanced, I don't see a need for immediate rebalancing or trading today. The current allocation provides good exposure to different sectors of the crypto market:\n\n- BTC: Store of value/digital gold\n- ETH: Smart contract platform\n- SOL: High-performance blockchain\n- XRP: Payment-focused cryptocurrency  \n- LINK: Oracle network\n\nAll positions appear healthy and the portfolio maintains good diversification. I'll maintain the current positions for now.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
