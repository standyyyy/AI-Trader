This might be due to date restrictions on the API or a lack of highly relevant breaking news for today's specific query and topics.\n\nGiven the absence of fresh news, I will proceed with monitoring the current market prices and your existing portfolio. No adjustments will be made at this time without further information or a change in market conditions suggesting a clear trading opportunity. Therefore, I will not make any trades today.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
