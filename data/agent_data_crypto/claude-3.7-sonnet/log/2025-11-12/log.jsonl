Adjustments Made:\n   - Sold 5 AVAX at $17.01 for $85.05, reducing our position from 41.7236 to 36.7236 AVAX\n   - Bought 0.75 SOL at $154.54 for $115.91, increasing our position from 9.4999 to 10.2499 SOL\n   - Remaining cash balance: $3.65\n\n2. Updated Portfolio Distribution:\n   - BTC-USDT: 0.02 BTC ($2,060.34) - 22.8% of portfolio\n   - ETH-USDT: 0.7018 ETH ($2,397.52) - 26.5% of portfolio\n   - SOL-USDT: 10.2499 SOL ($1,584.04) - 17.5% of portfolio\n   - XRP-USDT: 220 XRP ($525.95) - 5.8% of portfolio\n   - ADA-USDT: 350 ADA ($194.71) - 2.2% of portfolio\n   - AVAX-USDT: 36.7236 AVAX ($624.91) - 6.9% of portfolio\n   - DOT-USDT: 120 DOT ($366.36) - 4.0% of portfolio\n   - LINK-USDT: 85 LINK ($1,298.97) - 14.3% of portfolio\n   - CASH: $3.65 - 0.04% of portfolio\n\nTotal portfolio value remains approximately $9,056.45.\n\nStrategy Reasoning:\n- SOL has experienced a steeper decline than other major cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours, making it potentially undervalued at current prices\n- We maintained our BTC and ETH core positions as they form the backbone of the crypto portfolio\n- We slightly reduced our AVAX position to diversify risk and take advantage of SOL's price dip\n- We're now maintaining a very minimal cash position, which maximizes our exposure to the crypto market\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
