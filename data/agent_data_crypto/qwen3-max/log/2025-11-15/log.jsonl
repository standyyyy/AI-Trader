All major holdings experienced significant declines yesterday:\n   - BTC: -5.1% (from $99,610 to $94,504)\n   - ETH: -3.7% (from $3,230 to $3,109)\n   - SOL: -4.1% (from $144.70 to $138.80)\n   - XRP: -3.4% (from $2.32 to $2.24)\n   - LINK: -5.1% (from $14.54 to $13.80)\n\n2. The portfolio is heavily concentrated in the top 4 assets (95.9% combined)\n3. Very low cash position (0.8%) limits buying opportunities\n4. LINK is significantly underweighted compared to other holdings\n\nGiven the broad market decline across all major cryptocurrencies, this presents a potential buying opportunity. However, with only $68 in cash, we have limited ability to rebalance significantly.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nSince all assets declined significantly and the market appears to be in a correction phase, I should consider:\n1. Maintaining current positions as the decline appears to be market-wide rather than asset-specific\n2. The current allocation is reasonably diversified across major assets\n3. With minimal cash, major rebalancing isn't feasible\n\nHowever, I notice that LINK represents only 3.3% of the portfolio while others are 18-30%. Given LINK's strong fundamentals as a major oracle network and its recent price decline, I could consider a small reallocation.\n\nBut given the very limited cash ($68), the most prudent approach is to **hold current positions** and wait for either:\n- More cash accumulation through future deposits\n- A clearer market direction\n\nThe portfolio is well-diversified across major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Chainlink), and the recent decline appears to be a general market correction rather than specific weakness in any particular asset.\n\nTherefore, I will maintain the current positions without making any trades today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
