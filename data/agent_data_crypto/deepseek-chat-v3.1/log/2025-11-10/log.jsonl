However, I notice:\n- Significant exposure to BTC and ETH (48% of crypto portfolio)\n- SOL represents 25% of crypto portfolio\n- Smaller allocations to altcoins (XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOT, LINK)\n\n### Trading Recommendation:\nGiven the current market conditions and slight pullbacks in most assets, this appears to be a relatively stable position. The cash reserve of $1,325.61 provides flexibility for potential buying opportunities if markets decline further.\n\nNo immediate rebalancing actions are recommended based on the current analysis. The portfolio maintains a balanced approach with exposure to both large-cap (BTC, ETH) and mid-cap cryptocurrencies.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
