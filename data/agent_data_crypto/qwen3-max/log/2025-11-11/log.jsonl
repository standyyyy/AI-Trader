Let me verify the final portfolio:\n\n**Final Portfolio as of 2025-11-11:**\n- BTC: 0.0263 ($2,787.26)\n- ETH: 0.675 ($2,407.38)  \n- SOL: 11.25 ($1,882.24)\n- XRP: 825 ($2,083.45)\n- LINK: 20 ($327.20)\n- Cash: $68.05\n\n**Total Value: ~$9,555.58**\n\nThis rebalancing has:\n1. Eliminated the very small ADA position that wasn't providing meaningful diversification\n2. Increased XRP exposure to capitalize on potential ETF catalyst\n3. Added to SOL position to benefit from reported massive inflows\n4. Maintained core positions in BTC and ETH\n5.
