Since I don't have access to recent price history through the news function, let me check the current buying vs selling prices to understand the spread:\n\nLooking at the price differences:\n- BTC: Sell $109,555.27 → Buy $110,533.83 (0.89% spread)\n- ETH: Sell $3,845.79 → Buy $3,906.01 (1.57% spread)\n- SOL: Sell $187.14 → Buy $187.67 (0.28% spread)\n- XRP: Sell $2.5083 → Buy $2.5263 (0.72% spread)\n- ADA: Sell $0.6091 → Buy $0.6105 (0.23% spread)\n\nThe spreads are relatively normal for cryptocurrency markets.\n\nGiven the current portfolio allocation:\n- BTC and ETH are the core holdings (69.8% combined)\n- SOL has a reasonable 15% allocation\n- XRP and ADA provide additional diversification\n- Minimal cash position\n\nThis appears to be a well-structured portfolio with appropriate risk distribution. The allocation favors established, high-market-cap cryptocurrencies while maintaining some exposure to mid-cap assets.\n\nSince there are no major news events and the portfolio allocation looks reasonable, I don't see a need for significant rebalancing today. The current positions are appropriate for a diversified crypto portfolio focused on major assets.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
