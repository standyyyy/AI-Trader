However, there's significant cash holding (17.8%) that could be deployed strategically.\n\nLet me check for any rebalancing opportunities. Given the current market conditions and high volatility, I'll consider rebalancing to maintain target weights and capture potential opportunities.\n\nBased on the analysis, the portfolio appears reasonably balanced. The cash position provides flexibility for opportunistic buying during market dips. Given the high volatility in cryptocurrency markets, I'll maintain the current positions and use the cash for strategic opportunities as they arise.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
